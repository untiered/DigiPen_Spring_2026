- the sliders in the "options" menu have very small selectors. it feels like a chore to try and click on them.
- the SFX used to indicate that you are adjusting SFX are harsh on the ears
- the "environment" slider is unclear. what does "environment" mean? It's also hard to tell that anything changes when you adjust it (this isn't really a problem).
- the "voice" slider seems to do nothing.
- the background UI art for the options menu looks VERY placeholdery (----1----)
- the "back" button in the "level selection" menu doesn't have any SFX.
- the "start" and "main test level" buttons in the "level selection" menu have basic rectangular hitboxes. they should be polished to the same level as the buttons in the main menu.
- wasd only actually cause movement to take place ONCE the mech is facing that direction. this means you have to wait for the mech to slowely rotate until facing that direction before your input will cause any actual movement to take place. this feels horrible IMO.
- the mech can jump. is this what we want? (----2----)
- the camera cant look up or down (all the way). this feels horrible IMO.
- the camera feels like its too close to the player character IMO. when looking from certain angles, a LARGE portion of the screen is blocked by the mech itself.
- if you "jump" and (while in the air) look as far down(or up) as possible, after landing, your movement commands will only be about 5% as effective as they would be otherwise.
- the tutorial contains an orange door that is breakable. but there are two other orange doors lying in that same room which LOOK IDENTICAL, but are NOT breakable. this seems weird.
- we need animations. (----3----)
- the turret was able to shoot me through one of the storage containers (in the tutorial)
- the breakable door chunks (once broken, and BEFORE they dissipate) interact with the player character in a very clunky way. it feels horrible IMO.
- specifically in the tutorial, it takes an extremely long time for that ONE turret to activate. im not even sure it its guaranteed to active at all...?
- the player can walk into that breakable door and it will break.
- when attempting to exit the tutorial, the game crashes. I was unable to play the main level because of this. ("The UE HullHarvest game has crashed and will... "fatal error")
- when attempting to enter the procedural test level, the game crashes with the same error as when attempting to exit the tutorial.
