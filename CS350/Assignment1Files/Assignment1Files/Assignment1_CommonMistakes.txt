Assignment 1 Grading Common Mistakes:
Geometry.cpp:
  Barycentric Coordinates:
	Forgetting to check for zero division
	Not using the epsilon
	Not filling out the barycentric coords when the test returns false
  PointSphere and PointAabb:
	Not properly handling "<=" vs. "<"
  RayPlane:
	Not properly checking for a parallel ray
  RayTriangle: 
	Not using epsilon
	Not early outing if the ray doesn't hit the plane
  RaySphere:
	The ray missing the sphere
	The ray hitting the sphere but 1 or more t is invalid
  RayAabb:
	Calling RayPlane
	Not handling a ray direction being 0
  Frustum Tests:
    Not correctly handling intersection vs. outside. See notes for an explanation)
  
Shapes.cpp:
  Plane::Set: Not dealing with the plane normal being normalized
